# Building a Pseudocode Interpreter for Computer Science Education

*March 10, 2025*

One of the biggest challenges students face when learning programming is the gap between conceptual algorithms and actual code implementation. This is why I created a pseudocode interpreter in Python that bridges this gap.

## The Problem

Many students understand the logic behind algorithms but struggle with syntax when implementing them in a programming language. This creates an unnecessary barrier to learning the fundamental concepts of computer science.

## The Solution

My pseudocode interpreter translates human-readable algorithm descriptions into executable programs. The key features include:

- Support for natural language-like syntax
- Automatic translation to Python code
- Step-by-step execution visualization
- Error messages in plain language

## Technical Implementation

The interpreter consists of three main components:

1. **Lexical Analyzer**: Tokenizes the pseudocode input
2. **Parser**: Creates an abstract syntax tree
3. **Code Generator**: Produces executable Python code

## Future Improvements

I'm currently working on adding support for:

- Multiple language outputs (Python, JavaScript, C++)
- Interactive debugging tools
- Visual algorithm representations
