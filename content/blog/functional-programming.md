# Getting Started with Functional Programming

## Introduction

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

## Key Concepts

### Immutability
Data cannot be changed after creation. Instead of modifying existing data, you create new data structures.

### Pure Functions
Functions that always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects.

### Higher-Order Functions
Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.

## Example in Python

```python
def double(x):
    return x * 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
doubled = list(map(double, numbers))
print(doubled)  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## Benefits

- Easier to test and debug
- Better code reusability
- Improved parallelization
- More predictable code behavior

## Conclusion

Functional programming offers a different way of thinking about code that can lead to more maintainable and testable software.
