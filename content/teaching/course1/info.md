# Data Structures and Algorithms

*Fall 2024*

This course introduces fundamental data structures and algorithms that form the foundation of computer science. Students will learn how to analyze, implement, and apply various data structures and algorithms to solve computational problems efficiently.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the theoretical concepts behind common data structures
- Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms
- Implement fundamental data structures and algorithms in Python
- Apply appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve problems

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Discrete mathematics

## Teaching Approach

My teaching approach for this course combines theoretical foundations with hands-on implementation. Each concept is first explained through its theoretical underpinnings, followed by pseudocode examples, and finally concrete implementations in Python.

Students are encouraged to experiment with different implementations and analyze how their choices impact performance.
